# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard

## Problem Statement

To evaluate the performance of our pizza business and uncover actionable insights, we aim to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) derived from our sales data. The primary metrics to be calculated include:
1.	Total Revenue – The overall income generated from all pizza orders by summing up their total prices.
2.	Average Order Value – The mean spend per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the number of orders placed.
3.	Total Pizzas Sold – The cumulative quantity of pizzas sold across all transactions.
4.	Total Orders – The total count of unique orders processed.
5.	Average Pizzas per Order – The mean number of pizzas per order, calculated by dividing the total pizzas sold by the total orders.
